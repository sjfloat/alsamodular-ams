Kalsatools currently implements three applications:

AlsaModularSynth, a realtime modular synthesizer for ALSA.
                  All parameters can be modified in realtime 
                  via MIDI.

Kaconnect, which is a KDE version of the aconnect 
           utility for the ALSA sequencer system. 

KWaveView, a realtime scope and spectrum analyzer. 
           KWaveView captures sound from "Line In" 
           or "Mic In" and displays the sound waves 
           in the time domain and Fourier domain.


Example for AlsaModularSynth
----------------------------

Requires: vkeybd

1) Start Kaconnect and vkeybd. Enable "View"-->"Controls"
   and "View"-->"Pitchwheel" in vkeybd.
2) Start AlsaModularSynth with ams.
3) Use "File"-->"Load" to load /usr/share/doc/packages/kalsatools/example_basic.ams
4) Use Kaconnect to connect vkeybd and AlsaModularSynth.
5) Play vkeybd and listen to what happens when you move the pitch and
   modulation wheels !

In both examples you can adjust the volume by opening the configuration
dialog of the PCM output module. This is done by clicking with the right
mouse button on the module.
 
Kaconnect
---------

Kaconnect displays the readable and writable ports of the ALSA sequencer 
system. Connections between those ports can be subscribed by highlighting one 
port in the list of readable ports and one port in the list of writable ports 
and then mouseclicking on "connect". Disconnecting works the same way, but 
with mouseclick on "disconnect". 

The height of the listboxes can be configured using the --height option.
Note that Kaconnect automagically updates the lists when ALSA clients, 
which implement readable/writable ports, are started or terminated. The
display of subscribed connections is also updated whenever a new client is 
started or a new subscribtion is performed (also when using aconnect to 
subscribe/unsubscribe). 

KWaveView
---------

KWaveView displays the sound captured from "Line In" or "Mic In". On a
Soundblaster Live or Soundblaster Audigy, the sound can also be captured
internally. On these cards, the sound which is sent to the PCM output, can
be routed to the capture path. In alsamixer there are two sliders for this
purpose: "Wave" and "Wave Capture". "Wave" is the level for playback, 
"Wave Capture" is the capture level. On a Soundblaster Live, you have to
activate wave capture on the "Wave" slider. Use <space> to activate capture 
devices in alsamixer. Wave capture is always active on a Soundblaster Audigy.
The sound data can be displayed in the temporal as well as the Fourier domain. 
Both the scope and the spectrum analyzer can display two channels 
simultaneously, which can be selected from your input channels. Frequency 
areas can be enlarged in the spectrum view. The lower frequency boundary is 
determined by clicking the left mouse button in the spectrum view. Right 
clicking in the spectrum view determines the higher frequency boundary. 
Toggling between full frequency view and enlarged view is done by clicking 
the middle mouse button in the spectrum view. 
When moving the mouse in the spectrum, the frequency at the mouse cursor is 
displayed. For this feature to work also exactly in the enlarged view,
please make sure, not to change the number of frames and the window size
after you determined the boundaries for the enlargement. Otherwise you'll
get roundoff errors due to the conversion between mouse coordinates and 
frequency channels.

Have a lot of fun !
