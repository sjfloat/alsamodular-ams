 The VCF Module uses the resonant low-pass filter by Paul Kellett
 and the Cookbook formulae for audio EQ biquad filter coefficients
 by Robert Bristow-Johnson. The experimental Moog filters have been
 taken from http://musicdsp.org. They are based on the CSound source
 code, the paper by Stilson/Smith and modifications by Paul Kellett 
 and Timo Tossavainen. The pink noise conversion formula is by Paul 
 Kellett and has been taken from http://musicdsp.org as well.

 The author is grateful to Takashi Iwai for instructions about ALSA.
 Klaas Freitag, Helmut Herold, Stefan Hundhammer and Arvin Schnell

 hints regarding speed optimization. Torsten Rahn has helped to
 improve the color scheme of the program. Thanks to Bernhard Kaindl
 for helpful discussion. Bill Allen has contributed an improved 
 Makefile.
